# Bert-Chatbot demo

Architecture: Transformer architecture with bert encoder and transformer decoder. 

The folder named transformers has bert related code which is borrowed from [huggingface/transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) repo.
That means you don't need that folder if you install following python package..

```
pip install transformers
```
